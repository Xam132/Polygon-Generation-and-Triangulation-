# Polygon-Generation-and-Triangulation-

Minimum triangulation cost of polygon can be found using two methods
    1. Brute Force
    2. Dynamic Method

But we can also use greedy method, although greedy method doesnt provide correct result, we can analyse it to see where it deviated.
So here in MTCall file program for all costs of brute force, dynamic and greedy methods is coded
And in Greedy file it prints the diagonal choosen by greedy method, so we can see that choosing greediest first isnt alwayss viable in such cases
